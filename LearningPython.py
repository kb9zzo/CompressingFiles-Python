#I want to verify that I can output text
#I do this using the text "zero to hero"
print('zero to hero')


#custom format of text output
#this doesn't print the single quote
print('''First line
second line''')


#printing single or double quotes
print("I can print the double quote (\") using the the backslash")


#new line character
#output:
#
#first line
#second line
#

print("first line \nsecond line")
